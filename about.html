                I am an aspiring frontend developer who is passionate about creating beautiful and functional web experiences. My journey in tech started with a fascination for how websites work and a desire to build things that people can use and enjoy. I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I love the process of turning ideas into reality through code. I'm excited to grow my skills and contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference.

                    I believe in being honest about where I am in my learning journey. These are areas where I need to build knowledge and confidence:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript advanced concepts - still learning async/await, promises, and closures</li>

                    <li>Backend development - completely new to server-side programming and databases</li>

                    Dear Future Me,
                </p>
                <p class="profile-bio">
                    Right now, you're at the very beginning of your coding journey, and that's perfectly okay. You're starting the HNG internship with basic HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript knowledge, but more importantly, you have curiosity, determination, and a willingness to learn.
                </p>
                <p class="profile-bio">
                    Don't worry about not knowing React yet or being completely new to backend development. Every expert was once a beginner. Focus on understanding the fundamentals deeply, ask lots of questions, and don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's how you learn.
                </p>
                <p class="profile-bio">
                    Remember that progress isn't always linear. Some days will feel like breakthroughs, others might feel overwhelming. Both are part of the journey. Celebrate the small wins - your first working form, your first responsive layout, your first JavaScript function that works exactly as intended.
                </p>
                <p class="profile-bio">
                    Be patient with yourself, help others when you can, and never stop being curious about how things work.
                </p>
                <p class="profile-bio">
                    You've got this! ðŸ’ª

                <p class="profile-bio">
                    Starting a career in tech can feel overwhelming, but I'm excited about the possibilities ahead. I chose frontend development because I love the visual aspect of coding - seeing your work come to life in the browser is incredibly satisfying.
                </p>
                <p class="profile-bio">
                    I believe that everyone should have access to well-designed, accessible websites, and I want to be part of creating those experiences. Even though I'm just starting out, I'm committed to learning best practices and writing clean, maintainable code.
                </p>
                <p class="profile-bio">
                    My current setup: VS Code, lots of MDN documentation tabs, and a growing collection of coding tutorials. I'm learning that consistency beats intensity - a little coding every day goes a long way!

                <p class="profile-bio">
                    Fun fact: My first "Hello World" was just a few months ago, and now I'm building profile cards with forms and validation! ðŸš€
